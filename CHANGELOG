Changelog for Malware Finder
Version: 2.0.12 

Added
1. Introduced a user-friendly help prompt that shows up by default when the script is executed without any arguments.
2. Support for file extension filtering during directory scans, which allows the user to specify the file extension that the scanner should look for.
3. Ability to choose between scanning an individual file or a whole directory, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the tool.
4. Options for verbose output, debug mode, quarantine mode, and whitelist mode, thus allowing users to adjust the tool's behavior to suit their needs.
5. A SIGINT handler to gracefully stop the script execution when a SIGINT signal is received (e.g., Ctrl+C).
6. A function for loading signatures from a predefined location.
7. Banner information including script version, author, email, URL, scan date, and number of loaded signatures.
8. Applied the Apache License 2.0 to make the software open-source and permission-oriented, while also providing an explicit grant of patent rights to contributors.

Changed
1. Improved the argparse setup to handle the script's arguments more efficiently and provide a more intuitive user experience.
2. Enhanced the logic of the main function to handle the scan of individual files or directories based on the arguments provided.

Fixed
1. Fixed an issue where the script would exit with an error when no arguments were provided. Now, it defaults to showing the help prompt.

Removed
2. Removed the requirement to always provide either an individual file or a directory for scanning. Now, the script can start without any arguments, enhancing user-friendliness.

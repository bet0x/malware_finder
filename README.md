# Malware Finder

Malware Finder is a Python-based tool designed to scan file directories for suspicious malware signatures. This powerful script uses regular expressions stored in a database to identify malware patterns in files. This tool is especially handy for system administrators and security professionals who need to quickly audit large volumes of files.

## Features

- **Signature Based Scanning:** Utilizes a database of regular expression patterns to identify potential malware.
- **Multiprocessing:** Makes use of Python's multiprocessing capabilities to scan multiple files concurrently.
- **Flexible:** Can scan individual files or entire directories. Files can also be scanned based on their extension.
- **Whitelisting:** Provides an option to ignore certain files or directories during the scan.
- **Quarantine Option:** Detected files can be moved to a different location to prevent their execution.
- **Verbose and Debug Modes:** Additional output options for more information during the scan process.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the `malware_finder.py` script.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.3 or later installed on your machine.
3. Update the `signatures.db` file with the malware signatures you wish to scan for. These should be valid regular expressions.
4. If you wish to use the whitelist functionality, update the `whitelist.db` file with the paths of files or directories you wish to ignore during the scan.
5. Run the script from the command line as shown below:

```sh
python3 malware_finder.py -d /path/to/directory -f outputfile.txt -w
```

## Command Line Options

- `-d`, `--directory`: Path to directory to scan.
- `-i`, `--individual`: Path to individual file to scan.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Increase output verbosity.
- `-f`, `--file`: Output file name.
- `-e`, `--extension`: File extension to scan for.
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode (Show benchmark info).
- `-q`, `--quarantine`: Enable quarantine mode (Rename detected files).
- `-w`, `--whitelist`: Enable whitelist mode (Ignore files in whitelist).
